This project is a Maze Hub where users can choose to either play online maze games (where users are re-directed to an online maze solving platform) or help to build and run their own maze. To create one's own maze, users have the opportunity to add obstacles manually, change the start and end of the maze, as well as find a path from the start to the finish of the maze.

Key concepts that are applied here are: Handlers, Intents, Android XML manipulation, Activity creations and connections, as well as Dynamic generation of actions (such as obstacles). There is also some Java/Android manipulation to allow for a smooth user-friendly experience with the app.

To Run:

An AVD is used to run the program. In particular, it's called Pixel 4 API 31 (but should work on any Pixel device in general).

Make sure to CLEAN, RE-BUILD, and RUN the program upon opening the code within Xcode (the suggested platform to use if possible).
